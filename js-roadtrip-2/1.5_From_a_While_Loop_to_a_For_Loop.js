// Video 1.4 accompanies this exercise
// Write a basic for loop that prints to the console all
// the numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order. This is the similar to one
// of the previous challenges, but this time weâ€™re using a for loop instead
// of a while loop.

for (var num = -3; num <= -1; num++){
    console.log(num);
}
